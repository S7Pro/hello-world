  When I first saw a computer I was chocked and suprised in how computer performs its tasks in short time. I stared liking more and more so I was so curiose to what was in there that make it smooth and haevy as well in terms of weight.
  
  By the time time I start asking and wondering what is inside I end up open it and not knowing what to do or what was even doing because everything was working perfectly before I opened it.
  
  At that moment I got an aim to fix back the computer before my parents find out cause it was the main computer for the house in every aspect.
 
 I tried everything within my power to fix that back, but was all in vain and I just took it to the worst part as per my perspective cause the only thing that was wrong there were the cables I didn't pluged correctly.
 
 While in classe when my teacher said that computer language is case sensitive made reallize hardwers are too.
